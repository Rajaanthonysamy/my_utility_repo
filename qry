Aggregation queries are questions that involve counting, grouping, averaging, or summarizing data from the knowledge graph.
These queries typically include:

Counting entities (e.g., number of products, number of batches)

Filtering by date ranges (e.g., between Jan 2024 and Nov 2025)

Summarizing statuses (completed, ongoing, failed, etc.)

Statistical operations like MIN, MAX, AVG

GROUP BY operations (e.g., by product, by plant, by category)
